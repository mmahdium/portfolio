## 🎯 For AI Agents

When user asks to update resume, follow this workflow:

### **Step 1: Load Required Files**

Read these files in order:
1. `docs/RESUME-STANDARDS.md` - All standards, rules, and Decision Matrix
2. `app/data/portfolio.ts` - Source data (what user has done)
3. `app/data/resume.en.ts` - Target data (what needs updating)

### **Step 2: Compare & Analyze**

Find differences:
- New projects in portfolio not in resume?
- New skills in portfolio not in resume?
- New work experience or changes?

### **Step 3: Apply Decision Matrix**

Use Decision Matrix from `RESUME-STANDARDS.md`:
- Should this be in resume? (Yes/No)
- Where? (Summary, Work, Skills, Projects)
- How? (Apply content transformation rules)

### **Step 4: Generate Suggestions**

Follow rules from `RESUME-STANDARDS.md`:
- Use action verbs (Architected, Optimized, Led)
- Include metrics (percentages, numbers, scale)
- Mention AI tools with context
- Avoid clichés ("results-driven", "team player")
- Follow 3-line formula for summaries
- Achievement-first for work experience

### **Step 5: Validate**

Run Pre-Commit Checklist from `RESUME-STANDARDS.md`:
- [ ] Action verbs used
- [ ] Metrics included
- [ ] AI tools mentioned with context
- [ ] No clichés
- [ ] 2-page limit (~1000 words)
- [ ] ATS-compliant

### **Step 6: Present**

Show user:
1. What changed in portfolio
2. What to add/update in resume
3. Formatted suggestions
4. Validation results
